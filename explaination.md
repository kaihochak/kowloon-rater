# Code Explanation for Kowloon Rater

## 1. Queue.js Implementation

In `Queue.js`, the code implements a dynamic queue system where users can add, rename, and delete items. Key features include:

- **Dynamic Item Addition:** Users can add new items to the queue using the '+ New' button. Each new item is focusable and editable.
- **Renaming Items:** Clicking on an item turns its text into an editable field, allowing for immediate renaming.
- **Contextual Deletion:** Right-clicking on an item opens a context menu with a delete option.
- **Scrolling to New Items:** When a new item is added, the queue automatically scrolls to make the new item visible, enhancing user interaction.

## 2. MVP Pattern in RankingBoardPresenter.js and RankingBoard.js

The MVP (Model-View-Presenter) pattern is utilized to separate concerns and make the codebase scalable and maintainable:

- **RankingBoardPresenter.js:**
  - Acts as an intermediary between the model (`StateManager`) and the view (`RankingBoard`).
  - Registers listeners for state changes and updates the view accordingly.
  - Handles complex state change logic, ensuring the view reflects the current state of the game.

- **RankingBoard.js:**
  - Represents the UI layer, responsible for displaying the game's rating and ranking sections.
  - Responds to presenter commands to update the UI, such as highlighting the current target or showing final rankings.
  - Separation of concerns in MVP makes it easier to manage and update UI components.

## 3. State Management in State.js

The `state.js` file manages the application's state without using frameworks like Redux. Key aspects include:

- **Centralized State:** Holds the game's entire state, including rankings, ratings, and session progress.
- **Reducer Function:** Processes actions and updates the state accordingly, similar to Redux reducers.
- **Listener Registration:** Components can register listeners for specific parts of the state, ensuring targeted updates.
- **State Change Notification:** When the state changes, registered listeners are notified, allowing components to react to state changes.
- **Complex State Handling:** The implementation of a custom state management system demonstrates an understanding of core principles behind state management in modern web applications.
